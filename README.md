# Quick notice


### SEARCH tab
- Search in existing public graphs.
The search will be done on the title of graphs, descriptions and  contents of their cells.
In the result list, if the graph is published in public mode a "user" icon will appear on the same line.

### RANDOM tab
- Access a public random graph.

### LOGIN tab
- Allows you to log in.

### REGISTER tab
- Allows you to create an account to access additional features.

### SETTINGS tab *
- Allows you to modify your username, email and password or to delete your account (as well as all your graphs and suggestions). Don't forget to enter your current password to validate an action.

### ME tab *
- Displays an interface to manage all your graphs and invitations received.

- To create a new graph, simply press the "+" at the bottom and enter its title, description, whether you want it to be public (checkbox "Public") and if so whether if you want it to be associated with your account (checkbox "Anonym"). Currently a user can create up to 10 graphs.

- Modify a graph property (three dots icons):
    - To delete one of your graphs, simply press the "bin" icon associated with it in the list of your graphs.
		
    - To modify the title or description of a graph, modify it directly in the associated fields in the list of your graphs and do not forget to press save.

    - To modify the status of one of your graphs (public/anonym), modify it directly with the associated checkboxes in the list of your graphs.

    - To view/edit one of your graphs, click on the "eye" icon associated to it.





- Invitation management: \
    To revoke access to a graph you have received as a result of an invitation, click on the "remove" icon  in the list of your invitations. 

### GRAPH INTERFACE
- Tools for exploration: \
	At the top left of the graph view is an interactive outline for easy navigation. Classic window resizing buttons are available below the graph view (zoom in/zoom out/actual size/fit). \
	It is also possible to display the current graph in full screen to print it or display it (print and show buttons)
- Tools for modification*: \
	When you are the owner of a graph, you can edit the graph. \
	Graph components are on the left. You can drag them onto the drawing board. Once in place you can move it, write in it (by double clicking on it), resize it or change its colour by right clicking on it. \
	Arrows can also be moved, have text, move the ends and change colour. To create a link you can hold your mouse over the little "arrow" icon that appears, drag and drop it to the side of a cell. \
	The containers have the advantage of folding and unfolding while keeping the sub-graphs inside. Their names and colours can be changed. A container can contain another one. \
	The current keyboard shortcuts are activated. \
	"Organic layout" offers you an unmixed organisation of your graph. \
	Don't forget to save at the end of your edition! \

- You can invite particular people to make suggestions on your graph. This is only useful if the graph is not public. To do this enter the nickname of the guest and click on the "add" icon. To remove the guest, simply click on the icon next to the guest's name.

- View suggestions*: \
    The suggestions you have received are in the form of a list. If the suggestion was not made anonymously, a link to the suggestion author's account appears on the same line as the suggestion. When you select a suggestion, the graph display focuses on the box concerned (if it still exists). You must then evaluate the importance of the suggestion or report it if its content is harmful.

- Make a suggestion*: \
On a graph that does not belong to you, right click on one of the cells and click on "suggest". \
A form should appear: a field for the textual suggestion and a checkbox to allow the recipient to know or not from whom the suggestion comes.
